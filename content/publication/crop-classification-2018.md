abstract = "A novel tensorization framework is proposed, which utilizes the Kronecker product to combine multifrequency polarimetric synthetic aperture radar data in conjunction with an artificial neural network (ANN) for classification. The ANN comprises of two stages, where an unsupervised stochastic sampling autoencoder learns an efficient representation and a supervised feed forward network performs classification. The proposed framework is demonstrated using multifrequency (C-, L-, and P-bands) data sets collected by the AIRSAR system. The classification performance of single tensor product of dual- and triple-band combinations is evaluated. It is observed that the classification accuracy of the tensor products outperforms single, as well as, the simple augmentation of the frequency bands."
